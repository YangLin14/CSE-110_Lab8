Question: How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Sercice Workers allow the developers to make the app accessible when offline when supported. It's related to graceful degradtion because the app could start with the best possible experience with the service workers, but also ensure the the app to be useable and functionale on an older browser or in situations when the features can't be utlized. It's for building robust experience for the user on the app based of user environment.
